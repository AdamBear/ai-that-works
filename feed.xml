      <description><![CDATA[On #17 we talked about advanced context engineering workflows for using Claude code to work in complex codebases. This week, we're gonna get a little weird with it, and show off a bunch of ways you can use Claude Code as a generic agent to handle non-coding tasks. We'll learn things like: Skipping the MCP and having claude write its own scripts to interact with external systems, Creating internal knowledge graphs with markdown files, How to blend agentic retrieval and search with deterministic context packing

      <description><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, the Manus team published an excellent paper on context engineering. It covered KV Cache, Hot-swapping tools with custom samplers, and a ton of other cool techniques. On this week's episode, we'll dive deep on the manus Article and put some of the advice into practice, exploring how a deep understanding of models and inference can help you to get the most out of today's LLMs.

      <description><![CDATA[By popular demand, AI That Works #17 will dive deep on a new kind of context engineering: managing research, specs, and planning to get the most of coding agents and coding CLIs. You've heard people bragging about spending thousands/mo on Claude Code, maxing out Amp limits, and much more. Now Dex and Vaibhav are gonna share some tips and tricks for pushing AI coding tools to their absolute limits, while still shipping well-tested, bug-free code. This isn't vibe-coding, this is something completely different.

      <description><![CDATA[AI That Works #16 will be a super-practical deep dive into real-world examples and techniques for evaluating a single prompt against multiple models. While this is a commonly heralded use case for Evals, e.g. 'how do we know if the new model is better' / 'how do we know if the new model breaks anything', there's not a ton of practical examples out there for real-world use cases.
