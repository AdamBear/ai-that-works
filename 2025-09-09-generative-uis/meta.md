title: "Generative UIs and Structured Streaming"
description:
  We'll explore hard problems in building rich UIs that rely on streaming data from LLMs.
  ​Specifically, we'll talk through techniques for rendering **STRUCTURED** outputs from LLMs, with real-world examples of how to handle partially-streamed outputs over incomplete JSON data. We'll explore advanced needs like
  * Fields that should be required for stream to start
  * ​Rendering React Components with partial data
  ​* Handling nullable fields vs. yet-to-be-streamed fields
  * ​Building high-quality User feedback
  * ​Handling errors mid-stream
